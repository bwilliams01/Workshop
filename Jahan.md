# What is Human Development? By Selim Jahan


## Response for February 3rd, 2020


Jahan’s definition of human development primarily focuses on improving lives rather than advancing an economy. This aspect of human development predominantly supports Jahn’s idea of “of the people, for the people, and by the people.” Jahan’s main ideas of human development include augmenting the development of human capital, warranting that this capital will benefit human lives, and ensuring that everyone will actively benefit. Secondly, Jahan expresses the idea of opportunities within human development. By giving people more freedom to live, they will live a life of true value. In essence, this affects people’s abilities and allows them to develop their skills. Once the basics of human development are achieved, people are more likely to live a satisfied life. Finally, Jahan expresses the idea of choice in human development. Providing people with more than one opportunity enhances the number of choices they can make. While no one can guarantee complete human happiness, people can make educated choices on their own merit. Jahan articulates that human development should foster an environment “for the people” to be able to lead a productive lifestyle. He elaborates on the types of work that are of main concern today, including: youth employment, gender related work, rural work, the informal sector, and work during crisis/post-crisis. 

The Human Development Index uses the three components of people, opportunities, and choices to acquire knowledge about how to access the resources needed to maximize utility in a society. Data scientists evaluate GDP per capita, as well as access broader information about income per capita to interpret information about human lives.
  
Rosling uses the comparison of impoverished countries to the OECD to demonstrate when health was a precursor of wealth. In his first example, he uses the population growth Asia to portray the shift in socioeconomic status. As the population began to grow, people residing in Asia either overcame or succumbed to poverty. He explains that through the World Banks analysis of these patterns, the world will be less divided. Rosling then goes on to describe that various countries, although close geographically, can have completely different human development issues. Rosling also issues a warning to the audience that, although one may be looking at data of a country holistically, different subdivisions of that country can have different life expectancies and other factors. Through his analysis, he concluded that haste generalizations are dangerous when using averages.
