# What is Human Development?


## By Selim Jahan

Response for February 3rd, 2020

Jahan’s definition of human development primarily focuses on improving lives rather than advancing an economy. This aspect of human development mainly supports Jahn’s idea of “of the people, for the people, and by the people.” Enhancing development of human capital, ensuring that this capital will benefit human lives, and ensuring that everyone will actively benefit concludes Jahan’s main ideas of human development. Secondly, Jahan expresses the idea of opportunities within human development. By giving people more freedom to live, they will live a life of true value. In essence, this affects people’s abilities and allows them to develop their skills. Once the basics of human development are achieved, people are more likely to live a satisfied life. Finally, Jahan expresses the idea of choice in human development. Providing people with more than one opportunity enhances the number of choices they can make. While no one can guarantee complete human happiness, people can make educated choices on their own merit. Jahan expresses that human development should foster an environment “for the people” to be able to lead a productive lifestyle. Jahan elaborates on the types of work that are of main concern today, including: youth employment, gender related work, rural work, the informal sector, and work during crisis/post-crisis. 	
The Human Development Index uses the three components of people, opportunities, and choices to acquire knowledge about how to access the resources needed to maximize utility in a society. Data scientists evaluate GDP per capita, as well as access broader information about income per capita to interpret information about human lives.
