## Problem Statement

Define the problem. What is the harm I am seekoing to investigate and why is it significant within the context of my selected LMIC?

1. Vaqué, J. (2017, January 6). Chronology of the Dry Corridor: The impetus for resilience in Central America. http://www.fao.org/in-action/agronoticias/detail/en/c/1024539/.

   ​     This article is a brief overview of the climate crisis in Central America. For my project, I am specifically focusing on food and water insecurities caused by persistent natural disasters and other changes in climate. The Dry Corridor, also known as the Pacific side of Central America, is known for its unpredictable weather. Because of its location, Honduras is one of the countries involved that receives the most irregular rainfall. Many of Honduras rural residents live below the poverty line and are affected by this change in climate. The intensity of the droughts and floods have increased recently which has caused socioeconomic vulnerability and environmental degradation. The inhabitants in this area have very limited access to infrastructure, services, and resources to overcome the hardships of their circumstances. According to the article, roughly ten percent of the population in Honduras suffers from malnutrition. After his introduction of the Dry Corridor, Vaqué introduces a chronological order of natural disaster events that have occurred since 2000, including the irregular drought pattern of 2001, the “big blow” of 2009, the tropical depression Twelve-E, and when implementations were made in 2016. His analyses of the chronological events will provide evidence to further support my thesis of how climate change has affected the level of poverty, food and water resources, and job security in Honduras. Various sustainable development goals are considered in this article, including poverty, hunger, health, and economic growth. This idea relates to Amartya Sen’s idea that economic development is important for human development. Geospatial datasets cited within Vaqué’s research includes World Bank. Likewise, he uses this resource to evaluate the Dry Corridor and the people’s “resilience-building strategies.” He concludes that patterns of these drastic droughts and floods have caused a great number of citizens to suffer from the scarcity of food and water in the area, which in turn affects a number of human development issues. In sum, Vaqué examines the Dry Corridor, the main organizations that are supporting Central America to develop its strategies to overcome its hardships, and key moments in history that support the phenomenon of climate change.
