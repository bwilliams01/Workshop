#### **Introduction**

​		This literature review analyzes research surrounding disasters and its effects on child malnutrition in developing countries, specifically Haiti. Child malnutrition can be a cause of long-term effects such as inadequate dietary intake and diseases, as well as short term effects like natural disasters and political turmoil. For this research, natural disasters in Haiti and their impacts on child malnutrition are investigated. In 2010, Haiti was struck with a 7.0 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter at Léogâne, which devastated nearly 3 million Haitian people. As an immediate effect of this natural disaster, child malnutrition became a relevant developmental issue in Haiti. 

​		Haiti is notorious for malnutrition in the Western hemisphere (Cuneo, Dansereau, Habib 2017). Currently, 1 in 5 children in Haiti suffer from malnutrition (Meds & Food for Kids in Haiti). According to UNICEF's World’s Children 2015 Report, “Haiti’s under-five mortality was 73/1,000 live births and its infant mortality rates were high at 55 and 25 per 1,000 live births” (United Nations Children’s Fund). The effects of child malnutrition include irreversible physical, mental, and emotional detriment. This is predominantly because any children in Haiti and other developing countries lack adequate resources to maintain survival, including food, water, clothing, and substantial health services. Accessible and free education is also very limited and private education is expensive. 

​		Following the 2010 earthquake, various geospatial datasets have been able to track population disbursement in order to dispatch intense relief efforts. As evidenced in this literature review, various geospatial datasets are prevalent in the use to monitor the outspread of child malnutrition in Haiti in areas that were most impacted by the 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak. There is a correlation amongst all the sources to examine geospatial and machine learning solutions to distribute humanitarian aid, evaluate population distribution, and manage the cultural stress of post-disaster Haiti. In the context of Amartya Sen’s definition of human development, solving food security and protecting the country’s children is a basic human right. In order to be able to have sustainable growth within a nation, available healthcare services are imperative. Likewise, providing the resources to areas where child undernutrition is relevant will improve living conditions for the people of Haiti.

​		Gaps identified in this literature review include the improved conditions following the earthquake. Because humanitarian aid was fairly focused on the improvement of food security, malnutrition rates steadily decreased and aid efforts had been slowly removed. Thus, it is unclear if the sudden removal of aid contributes to any geospatial evidence of the prevalence of malnutrition. Additionally, because the investigated disaster is solely the 2010 earthquake, which predates Hurricane Matthew of 2016 or the cholera outbreak, data is slightly skewed or can be interpreted irrelevant as future disasters impact these statistics and research. Finally, social determinants of child malnutrition, such as are hardly researched. In countries where child malnutrition is extreme, it is important to research the population distribution of these children in order to allocate resources properly.

##### Child Malnutrition in Haiti: DHS & SMART Survey Data

​		Haiti is known to be notorious for high child mortality rates due to food insecurity. Following the earthquake of 2010, there was unprecedented loss of human life, vegetation, and physical infrastructure. In response, Haiti received intensive humanitarian aid in order to account for these several losses. According to Ayoya et al, the Haitian government predominantly focused on improving nutrition amongst the coastal communes heavily impacted, especially Gonaives, Jacmel, Leogane, Petit Goave, and Port-au-Prince (Ayoya et al 2013). The bases of Ayoya’s research imply that these affected areas lacked nutrition services. For their research method, they evaluated trends in child malnutrition from the Haiti Demographic and Health Survey (HDHS) from 2005-06. Additionally, they investigated trends following the earthquake from a Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) survey dated in 2012. As stated in the article, Haiti had undergone extensive effort caring for the nutrition of the children impacted by the earthquake. Services including inpatient stabilization, outpatient programs, optimal infant feeding practices continued well into May of 2012. 

​		By conducting household surveys via SMART methodologies, the authors were able to analyze growth data amongst “2,463 (HDHS 4) and 4,727 (SMART) children ages 0–59 months” (391). Following the rural- urban stratification of this data, “clusters of at least 25 households were randomly selected from each sampling area.” The authors were able to compare the 2 surveys and concluded that overall child malnutrition significantly declined due to humanitarian relief efforts following the earthquake. There are an additional number of reasons for the decline: women attending antenatal care, vaccination for the measles, diarrheal disease remedies, vitamin supplementation, and availability of potable water. 

​		A gap within their research includes failure to absolutely identify the reason for this decline. It is stated by the researchers that they are unclear if the child malnutrition rates were steadily increasing on their own, or if the earthquake accelerated any relief action. Additionally, they authors assume that the earthquake caused rural-to-urban migration within Haiti, however no data was available at the time of their research. 

​		Ultimately, DHS data serves as a great resource to track child undernutrition in developing countries. In “Child hunger in the Developing World: An analysis of environmental and social correlates,” the authors researched several countries and their trends in geographical locations of their citizens. Example covariates to establish a basis surrounding nutrition include “soil quality, agricultural production, population density and distance to a port” (Balk et al 2004). It was interpreted that these variables affect various household conditions, including education and parental involvement. Furthermore, they researched the correlation of child malnutrition and these biophysical variables via geographical location. In their studies, the authors noted that since DHS is a broad scale and cross-sectional means of receiving data, the sampling frame on specific questions may have few shortcomings. This gap was noted twice amongst their research. 

​		The authors note Haiti specifically. At the time, they researched Haiti in 2000 (pre-earthquake). Differing from Ayoya’s research, 2263 children aged 1-3 with “valid anthropometry” were included in the data set. In an attempt to investigate the effects of geographical and environmental factors that affect child nutrition, the authors uncovered that children who were vaccinated and breastfed were less likely to be impacted. Likewise, those who were located near areas with fertile soil, potable water, and suboptimal levels of agriculture were also less likely to be impacted. 

​		Overall, DHS provides a strong basis in evaluating the effects the environment has on child malnutrition. By evaluating the differences in rates, researchers and governments have a clearer sense of where to allocate resources to combat malnutrition. Both Ayoya & Balk used DHS to investigate these trends in child malnutrition.
