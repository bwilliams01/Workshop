**Introduction**

<div align="left">​		This literature review analyzes research surrounding disasters and its effects on child malnutrition in developing countries, specifically Haiti. Child malnutrition can be a cause of long-term effects such as inadequate dietary intake and diseases, as well as short term effects like natural disasters and political turmoil. For this research, natural disasters in Haiti and their impacts on child malnutrition are investigated. In 2010, Haiti was struck with a 7.0 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter at Léogâne, which devastated nearly 3 million Haitian people. As an immediate effect of this natural disaster, child malnutrition became a relevant developmental issue in Haiti. 

​		Haiti is notorious for malnutrition in the Western hemisphere (Cuneo, Dansereau, Habib 2017). Currently, 1 in 5 children in Haiti suffer from malnutrition (Meds & Food for Kids in Haiti). According to UNICEF's World’s Children 2015 Report, “Haiti’s under-five mortality was 73/1,000 live births and its infant mortality rates were high at 55 and 25 per 1,000 live births” (United Nations Children’s Fund). The effects of child malnutrition include irreversible physical, mental, and emotional detriment. This is predominantly because any children in Haiti and other developing countries lack adequate resources to maintain survival, including food, water, clothing, and substantial health services. Accessible and free education is also very limited and private education is expensive. This paper intends to investigate the usefulness of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), satellite, and spatial video data has on predicting, comparing, and illustrating the effects the 2010 earthquake had on Haitian nutrition for children.

**Human Development Topic**

<div align="left">
  
  ​		For development to improve within lower to middle income countries, having access to sustainable and reliable healthcare is vital to expand one’s society. A major concern for development in these developing countries, especially Haiti, is their child mortality and malnutrition rates. Following the 2010 earthquake, various geospatial datasets have been able to track population disbursement in order to dispatch intense relief efforts. As evidenced in this literature review, population based survey data has been proven to be prevalent in the use to monitor the outspread of child malnutrition in Haiti in areas that were most impacted by the 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak. There is a correlation amongst all the sources to examine geospatial and machine learning solutions to distribute humanitarian aid, evaluate population distribution, and manage the cultural stress of post-disaster Haiti. In the context of Amartya Sen’s definition of human development, solving food security and protecting the country’s children is a basic human right. In order to be able to have sustainable growth within a nation, available healthcare services are imperative. Likewise, providing the resources to areas where child undernutrition is relevant will improve living conditions for the people of Haiti.

​		According to University of Delaware's Disaster Research Center, sectoral conditions that had substantial impact following the quake are as follows: drinking water, energy/fuel/utilities, sanitation, education, healthcare, shelter, food and food-preparation items, livelihood, safety, social networks, and clearing of debris. These conditions were noted to have a disruption on the direct development of Haiti and stunted the process. However, four months after the earthquake, researchers uncovered that the conditions needed to improve nutrition and healthcare within the country improved significantly (i.e. drinking water, health care). Through their research, they discovered that availability of food significantly improved, yet the access was lagging severely. This is mainly accredited to the fact that it was a necessity to feed those affected by the quake, which led to a depletion in the agriculture industry.

 **Geospatial Data Methods: DHS & SMART Survey Data**	

<div align="left">
  
 ​		Haiti is known to be notorious for high child mortality rates due to food insecurity. Following the earthquake of 2010, there was unprecedented loss of human life, vegetation, and physical infrastructure. In response, Haiti received intensive humanitarian aid in order to account for these several losses. According to Ayoya et al, the Haitian government predominantly focused on improving nutrition amongst the coastal communes heavily impacted, especially Gonaives, Jacmel, Leogane, Petit Goave, and Port-au-Prince (Ayoya et al 2013). The bases of Ayoya’s research imply that these affected areas lacked nutrition services. For their research method, they evaluated trends in child malnutrition from the Haiti Demographic and Health Survey (HDHS) from 2005-06. Additionally, they investigated trends following the earthquake from a Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) survey dated in 2012. As stated in the article, Haiti had undergone extensive effort caring for the nutrition of the children impacted by the earthquake. Services including inpatient stabilization, outpatient programs, optimal infant feeding practices continued well into May of 2012. 

​		By conducting household surveys via SMART methodologies, the authors were able to analyze growth data amongst “2,463 (HDHS 4) and 4,727 (SMART) children ages 0–59 months” (391). Following the stratification of this data, clusters composed of 25 households were randomly chosen via sampling areas. The authors were able to compare the 2 surveys and concluded that overall child malnutrition significantly declined due to humanitarian relief efforts following the earthquake. There are an additional number of reasons for the decline: women attending antenatal care, vaccination for the measles, diarrheal disease remedies, vitamin supplementation, and availability of potable water.

​		 A gap within their research includes failure to absolutely identify the reason for this decline. It is stated by the researchers that they are unclear if the child malnutrition rates were steadily increasing on their own, or if the earthquake accelerated any relief action. Additionally, they authors assume that the earthquake caused rural-to-urban migration within Haiti, however no data was available at the time of their research. 

​		Ultimately, DHS data serves as a great resource to track child undernutrition in developing countries. In “Child hunger in the Developing World: An analysis of environmental and social correlates,” the authors researched several countries and their trends in geographical locations of their citizens. Example covariates to establish a basis surrounding nutrition include “soil quality, agricultural production, population density and distance to a port” (Balk et al 2004). It was interpreted that these variables affect various household conditions, including education and parental involvement. Furthermore, they researched the correlation of child malnutrition and these biophysical variables via geographical location. In their studies, the authors noted that since DHS is a broad scale and cross-sectional means of receiving data, the sampling frame on specific questions may have few shortcomings. This gap was noted twice amongst their research. 

​		The authors note Haiti specifically within their dataset. At the time, they researched Haiti in 2000 (pre-earthquake). Differing from Ayoya’s research, 2263 children aged 1-3 with “valid anthropometry” were included in the data set. In an attempt to investigate the effects of geographical and environmental factors that affect child nutrition, the authors uncovered that children who were vaccinated and breastfed were less likely to be impacted. Likewise, those who were located near areas with fertile soil, potable water, and suboptimal levels of agriculture were also less likely to be impacted. 

​		Overall, DHS provides a strong basis in evaluating the effects the environment has on child malnutrition. By evaluating the differences in rates, researchers and governments have a clearer sense of where to allocate resources to combat malnutrition. Both Ayoya & Balk used DHS to investigate these trends in child malnutrition.

**Geospatial Data Method: Satellite and Aerial Imagery**

<div align="left"> 
  
 ​				As another means to investigate child malnutrition and other negative effects of the 2010 earthquake, researchers at UD Disaster Research Center utilized three types of data collecting techniques: “(1) automated, semi-automated, and visual analysis of high resolution satellite and aerial remote sensing imagery; (2) acquisition and interpretation of street-view GPS referenced photographs and video using the VIEWSTM field data collection system; and (3) interviews with NGOs; community members and leaders; service providers involved in community-scale relief, response, and recovery efforts; and representatives of government utility agencies” (Adams et al 2010). 

​			For this paper specifically, the first means of data collection will be analysed. Their study focused on seven geographically diverse communities within the earthquake-affected area in Haiti: Bel Air, Delmas-32, and Martissant within Port-au-Prince, and Grand Goâve, Gressier, Léogâne, and Petit Goâve. Within these communities, they assessed buildings pre-quake, post-quake, and early recovery through aerial imagery processed through the Global Earth Observation Catastrophe Assessment Network (GEO-CAN). Through their satellite imagery from pre-quake, post-quake, and early recovery, they were able to capture building destruction/recovery. This, in turn, affects the availability of food sources; however, their research highlights that geographically placed markets were not the issue with their food dilemma. Instead, it affected imported goods due to the destruction of the port. This had an adverse effect on food stock market prices, thus decreasing the citizens purchasing power. Thankfully due to previous disasters, like the Hurricane in 2008, humanitarian aid had already been prevalent in Haiti. The researchers uncovered that the disruption of these conditions (i.e. drinking water, health care) and damage were not linear and were complex. Additionally, no community prevaled to be more developed than another. 

​		While this data is crucial in identifying nutrition trends via aerial and satellite imagery, there are a few gaps within their research. Primarily, there is little evidence on how the quake affected children directly. It is assumed that food impacts a wide variety of demographics, including children, yet there is no conclusive data surrounding the impacts on young children. Additionally, as previously stated, there is no linear correlation between disruption of these conditions and destruction of buildings. The researchers state that since there were a sequence of natural disasters prior to the earthquake, there is no conclusive evidence of whether the environmental turmoil also had an impact on these conditions. They state that the relationship between damage and disruption is extremely complex and requires further investigation in terms of recovery.

**Geospatial Data Method: Spatial Video**	

<div align="left">
  
​			Similar to aerial and satellite imagery, spatial video was used to determine health risks within Haiti following the earthquake. Curtis, Blackburn, Widmer, & Morris (2013) composed a fine-scale geospatial research analysing health risks in developing urban areas. The case study ultimately maps out health risks within the coastal communities of Haiti--the specific areas where the earthquake hit. Methodically, the authors evaluate spatial video to collect information regarding water, trash accumulation, and other covariates that identify population and other cultural phenomena. The data was later digitized into Google Earth then interpreted into a GIS and spatial filtering approaches. They found that there were heavily concentrated sources of diarrheal disease, which is quite prevalent in children affected by malnutrition. Similarly, they found concentrated areas near schools, which is prevalent for cholera education prevention. Overall, their results yielded that health risk data vary in concentration, however schools ran a high risk in contracting these health risks, or hot spots. They concluded that the spatial video method is beneficial in identifying health risks, such as child malnutrition, in order to improve the area or allocating resources. The process is described as rapid and can be repeated a number of times.

​			As stated in the article, one of the main United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is addressing health risks associated with informal settlements. This idea is similar to Haiti’s developmental goals of improving health services and improving food security. Predominantly, population data in Haiti is derived from cell phone data; however, population is debated within post-earthquake towns, ranging from either 120,000 to 30,000. Therefore, the article's main intention is to research whether spatial video can provide a more accurate and updated method of fine-scale data input layer suitable for inclusion in other modeling frames. Or, in other words, whether it can be used to make a spatial risk assessment for evaluating traditional disease related variables, and map nearby schools in the community.
