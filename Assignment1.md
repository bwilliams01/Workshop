​	            This article explains how undernutrition in Haiti the leading cause of child mortality due to both socioecological and socioeconomic factors. Haiti is ranked among the poorest countries in the world, all ascribed by natural disasters, disease, and political distress. After the record-breaking earthquake in 2010, Haiti has struggled to resolve their food insecurities. The author of the article focuses on the epicenter of the 2010 earthquake, Léogâne, and its child net malnutrition. The author notes that various factors contribute to this morbid fatality, including "clean water, sanitation, and health services." He expresses that the lack in "diversity" in Haitian children's diet allows them to become more susceptible to illnesses such as Diarrheal Disease, the lead cause of child mortality in the area. Alongside food insecurity, healthcare in Haiti is severely inadequate. The article notes that approximately 40% of the population lacks adequate healthcare services, and 50% lack the ability to retrieve basic prescriptions. Within the article, it is concluded that the populations hardships, including child undernutrition, are a result of the earthquake that occurred a decade ago. 

​    		  The article relates to Amartya Sen's idea that healthcare is essential within a person's life. In order to be able to have sustainable growth within a nation, available healthcare services are imperative. The sustainable development goals considered within the study align with the Haitian Government goals of improving water, sanitation, and food security. Through analyzing the undernutrition of children in Léogâne, Haiti with geographical weighted datasets (GWS) and geographic information systems (GIS), the study concluded that there is promising development in Haiti's child malnutrition issue. The authors use these geospatial datasets and methodically hold cross-sectional household surveys of the region. GWR was specifically used to evaluate how "undernutrition and its household variants vary across the region." These geospatial datasets have given a more profound insight on how improve nutrition within various regions. The study aimed to characterize child undernutrition in Haiti through the usage of GWR and concluded with their methods that undernutrition in children were often found in "pockets" of the area, rather than being evenly distributed in the region's entirety.
