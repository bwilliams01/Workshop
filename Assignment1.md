## Problem Statement

Define the problem. What is the harm I am seeking to investigate and why is it significant within the context of my selected LMIC?

​	            This article explains how undernutrition in Haiti the leading cause of child mortality due to both socioecological and socioeconomic factors. Haiti is ranked among the poorest countries in the world, all ascribed by natural disasters, disease, and political distress. After the record-breaking earthquake in 2010, Haiti has struggled to resolve their food insecurities. The author of the article focuses on the epicenter of the 2010 earthquake, Léogâne, and its child net malnutrition. The author notes that various factors contribute to this morbid fatality, including "clean water, sanitation, and health services." He expresses that the lack in "diversity" in Haitian children's diet allows them to become more susceptible to illnesses such as Diarrheal Disease, the lead cause of child mortality in the area. Alongside food insecurity, healthcare in Haiti is severely inadequate. The article notes that approximately 40% of the population lacks adequate healthcare services, and 50% lack the ability to retrieve basic prescriptions. Within the article, it is concluded that the populations hardships, including child undernutrition, are a result of the earthquake that occurred a decade ago. 

​    		  The article relates to Amartya Sen's idea that healthcare is essential within a person's life. In order to be able to have sustainable growth within a nation, available healthcare services are imperative. The sustainable development goals considered within the study align with the Haitian Government goals of improving water, sanitation, and food security. Through analyzing the undernutrition of children in Léogâne, Haiti with geographical weighted datasets (GWS) and geographic information systems (GIS), the study concluded that there is promising development in Haiti's child malnutrition issue. The authors use these geospatial datasets and methodically hold cross-sectional household surveys of the region. GWR was specifically used to evaluate how "undernutrition and its household variants vary across the region." These geospatial datasets have given a more profound insight on how improve nutrition within various regions. The study aimed to characterize child undernutrition in Haiti through the usage of GWR and concluded with their methods that undernutrition in children were often found in "pockets" of the area, rather than being evenly distributed in the region's entirety.

​         This article assesses the malnutrition in Southern Haiti using EMR data. Alex Coston gives a brief background of Haiti's malnutrition issue, especially following the 2010 earthquake and a severe rain season. He explains that by using geographically information systems, data scientists will be able to understand the underlying conditions and reasoning for malnutrition and the "geospatial risk factors of a region." Coston then explains how in Port Salut, Klinik Timoun Nou Yo (KTNY) developed a nutrition program for children in the region, which directly relates to the issue I am evaluating. Coston evaluates KTNY tracker, a GIS tool developed to aid KTNY and their studies surrounding patient distribution. To support this tracker, data from 2013 and 2014 was plugged into the software and yielded results that concluded that most children affected by malnutrition reside along the coast of Haiti, as well as less dense areas. Coston then discusses how the KTNY tracker alongside QGIS will be useful and easy to analyze clinical data as well as serve as a "visual advocate" towards increase funding for children malnutrition program efforts. 

​         By increasing access to child malnutrition programs, Coston's solution aligns with Amartya Sen's definition of human development. Providing the resources to areas where child undernutrition is relevant will improve living conditions for the people of Haiti. Through his research, Coston analyses the social and economic means of human development by introducing KTNY to affected children. Although it is not explicitly stated, by analyzing the population distribution of affect children, it enables these programs to help the economic and social status of the affected regions. Similarly, the sustainable development goal most relevant to the research are goal 2 (zero hunger) and goal 3 (good health and wellbeing). By using this tracker, it enables researchers to understand where to distribute clinics and how to improve the undernutrition dilemma. Coston uses the innovative geospatial dataset KTNY as well as the electronic medical record (EMR) to efficiently map their malnutrition data. Finally, by mapping the information from 2013 and 2014, Coston was able to answer his question of whether KTNY would be a valuable GIS dataset to analyze malnutrition in Haiti. He concludes that, while it proved to be efficient and valuable in analyzing these trends, there still needs to be future development in the program itself and access to care disparities.   


3. Balk, Deborah, et al. “Child Hunger in the Developing World: An Analysis of Environmental and Social Correlates.” *Food Policy*, Pergamon, 10 Nov. 2005, www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919205000886

This article correlates undernutrition of children in developing countries with environmental and household factors. As a broad overview of the subject in terms of the entirety of the developing world, this source analyses each specific country, the year the data was recorded, the number of children studied, and their aggregate-level regression. The authors state that social scientists have shown that household factors, such as birth order and school all have influences on child undernutrition in the developing world. Likewise, the authors note that there are also hereditary, environmental, and gender differences amongst the various countries' child nutritional outcomes. The authors begin their study by "converting spatial information into survey units and vise-versa to analyze these various demographic determinants of child malnutrition. They ultimately conclude that a country's environment can be a indication of how nutrition affects children; however, they were unable to identify the "full-suite" of the individual and house-hold indicators. Despite this, they were able to identify household characteristics that were a result of undernutrition for children, such as whether or not a child is breastfed. They also concluded that environmental differences like soil fertility, water availability, and access to food markets impact the pattern of poverty levels, thus creating a suboptimal living environment for children. 

​      The authors conclusion that household differences, environment, and socio-economics all have an impact on the availability of food coincide with Amartya's idea of how an income increase can benefit the development of a society. Specifically, their study addresses socio-economic and cultural differences among countries. Haiti specifically is not addressed although they provide data for the country. In totality though, Haiti's sustainable goal of improving socioeconomics is addressed in the research paper. The authors use external geospatial datasets like GPS-point locations and DHS data to analyze the prevalence of malnutrition in Africa with population and road density mapping. With these datasets, the authors "undertook a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to test hypotheses from the UNICEF framework" to measure the compatibility of the data. By calculating the Z-scores of the children as well as the standard deviations, they were able to observe weight trends of children aged 1-3. Overall, the authors were able to answer their hypothesis that household and environmental factors affect the nutritional availability for children in developing countries.
