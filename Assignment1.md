## Problem Statement

Define the problem. What is the harm I am seeking to investigate and why is it significant within the context of my selected LMIC?

​	            This article explains how undernutrition in Haiti the leading cause of child mortality due to both socioecological and socioeconomic factors. Haiti is ranked among the poorest countries in the world, all ascribed by natural disasters, disease, and political distress. After the record-breaking earthquake in 2010, Haiti has struggled to resolve their food insecurities. The author of the article focuses on the epicenter of the 2010 earthquake, Léogâne, and its child net malnutrition. The author notes that various factors contribute to this morbid fatality, including "clean water, sanitation, and health services." He expresses that the lack in "diversity" in Haitian children's diet allows them to become more susceptible to illnesses such as Diarrheal Disease, the lead cause of child mortality in the area. Alongside food insecurity, healthcare in Haiti is severely inadequate. The article notes that approximately 40% of the population lacks adequate healthcare services, and 50% lack the ability to retrieve basic prescriptions. Within the article, it is concluded that the populations hardships, including child undernutrition, are a result of the earthquake that occurred a decade ago. 

​    		  The article relates to Amartya Sen's idea that healthcare is essential within a person's life. In order to be able to have sustainable growth within a nation, available healthcare services are imperative. The sustainable development goals considered within the study align with the Haitian Government goals of improving water, sanitation, and food security. Through analyzing the undernutrition of children in Léogâne, Haiti with geographical weighted datasets (GWS) and geographic information systems (GIS), the study concluded that there is promising development in Haiti's child malnutrition issue. The authors use these geospatial datasets and methodically hold cross-sectional household surveys of the region. GWR was specifically used to evaluate how "undernutrition and its household variants vary across the region." These geospatial datasets have given a more profound insight on how improve nutrition within various regions. The study aimed to characterize child undernutrition in Haiti through the usage of GWR and concluded with their methods that undernutrition in children were often found in "pockets" of the area, rather than being evenly distributed in the region's entirety.

​         This article assesses the malnutrition in Southern Haiti using EMR data. Alex Coston gives a brief background of Haiti's malnutrition issue, especially following the 2010 earthquake and a severe rain season. He explains that by using geographically information systems, data scientists will be able to understand the underlying conditions and reasoning for malnutrition and the "geospatial risk factors of a region." Coston then explains how in Port Salut, Klinik Timoun Nou Yo (KTNY) developed a nutrition program for children in the region, which directly relates to the issue I am evaluating. Coston evaluates KTNY tracker, a GIS tool developed to aid KTNY and their studies surrounding patient distribution. To support this tracker, data from 2013 and 2014 was plugged into the software and yielded results that concluded that most children affected by malnutrition reside along the coast of Haiti, as well as less dense areas. Coston then discusses how the KTNY tracker alongside QGIS will be useful and easy to analyze clinical data as well as serve as a "visual advocate" towards increase funding for children malnutrition program efforts. 

​         By increasing access to child malnutrition programs, Coston's solution aligns with Amartya Sen's definition of human development. Providing the resources to areas where child undernutrition is relevant will improve living conditions for the people of Haiti. Through his research, Coston analyses the social and economic means of human development by introducing KTNY to affected children. Although it is not explicitly stated, by analyzing the population distribution of affect children, it enables these programs to help the economic and social status of the affected regions. Similarly, the sustainable development goal most relevant to the research are goal 2 (zero hunger) and goal 3 (good health and wellbeing). By using this tracker, it enables researchers to understand where to distribute clinics and how to improve the undernutrition dilemma. Coston uses the innovative geospatial dataset KTNY as well as the electronic medical record (EMR) to efficiently map their malnutrition data. Finally, by mapping the information from 2013 and 2014, Coston was able to answer his question of whether KTNY would be a valuable GIS dataset to analyze malnutrition in Haiti. He concludes that, while it proved to be efficient and valuable in analyzing these trends, there still needs to be future development in the program itself and access to care disparities.
