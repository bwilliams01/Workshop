# Anderson & Kitchin Response

February 24, 2020

Anderson describes what he calls the "death of theory." What did he mean by this statement? In response, Kitchin offers a rebuttal to Anderson. What do you think? Has Big Data killed theory?

 
## Response

In Anderson's article, he describes that algorithms associated with Big Data will eventually overpower data scientists who create theories and hypothesis for a living. In other words, hypothesising and creating theories will eventually be eliminated by algorithms that can easily identify patterns. Alongside Anderson's argument, Kitchin agrees and states that Big Data has become a fourth paradigm within science. Due to data-intensive, statistical exploraiton, and data mining, Big Data can easily identify a consumers interests based of algorithmic data. Major companies, such as Google, Inc., Facebook, and Walmart all use Big Data in order to evaluate their large consumer base. Kitchin describes how Amazon's recommendation list is not produced based off knowing the consumer personally, but rather based off patterns of purchases across a variety of consumers with similar consumption patterns. Kitchin then describes that, although Big Data is essential to evaluate trends of consumers, it does not exactly mean the "end of theory," as Anderson describes. Various sciences, specifically social science, rely on theoretical framework to validate their methodology. 

I agree with Kitchin that, while Big Data is useful to address consumer patterns, we should not entirely rely on it and eliminate theory due to its limitations. Most data derived from these social media and consumer platforms are a biased audience. These consumer samples are oftentimes less diverse, and in order to have an accurate representation, we need to eliminate all sorts of bias. People from different socioeconomic and geographical backgrounds produce different information, and Big Data can fail to include this segment.
