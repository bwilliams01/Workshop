##### In the readings for Monday and today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

In the article, “Disaggregating Census Data for Population Mapping Using Random Forests with Remotely-Sensed and Ancillary Data,” the authors describe an estimation technique called “Random Forest.” Specifically, the authors use this technique to evaluate population distribution throughout Kenya, Vietnam, and Cambodia. This statistical algorithm generates an estimation of population distribution. The technique generates different "trees" as a machine learning algorithm. 

##### The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events?

Machine learning algorithms programs that adjust as more data is received and make predictions. Machine learning is able to notice various paterns than classic statistical approaches are unable to identify. 



##### In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?



The authors evaluate numerous geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning methods. For example, they mention nighttime lights and temperature as covariates in the RF study. Big data is significant in machine learning methods because it provides more affective, reasonable, and accurate data to explain population distribution.



##### The authors’ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth?

Having accurate and specific data regarding human population is significant within the contect of human development in LMICs because it allows researchers and scientists to evaluate population growth and density in these impoverished areas in order to distribute needed resources within a given area. 

##### Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?

It is important to know where people are located and living via household information predominately to measure how far these households are from health facilities and other resources that are only available within a reasonable distance from a home. By having a greater sense of where people reside, researchers, scientists, and even governments can have a greater understanding of people's socioeconomic level as well as their ability to be provided basic human resources.
